Create Release Branch (Ex release_v5.0)

PR Checks
------------
Check if the PR has a target branch of main. If so error the PR with message.
PR Labels should match the JIRA Fix Version value.
Obtain Label from the PR. If no label, error the PR with message (Ex Release_V5.0)
Check if the target branch name matches with the label. It it does not, error the PR with message
Check if the PR Release Label matches with the JIRA Fix Version value. Throw and error if does not.

Merge Builds
------------
Code merging into the release branch through PR gets a tag with the build number added to the release (Ex 5.0.xx)
Deployment images are pushed up with the tag created (Ex 5.0.xx)
Code is NOT merged to main from the Release Branch until it is cleared UAT.
Once UAT clears, the branch is merged into main
Upon merging to main it gets a release tag that reads Final as the build number (Ex 5.0.Final)
Any code that makes to main is then merged back to pending Release branches (manual job)

Hotfix
--------------
Any hotfixes to be created from the current release branch that is in production.
A Branch (ex. release_v5.1) will be created. the last octet will be upped by 1 every time a hotfix needs to be deployed.
Any tickets created for the Hotfix will be marked with the Fix version of that release.
Developers can create story branches and tag their PRs with the current production release.
PRs created will follow the same rules as above in PR Checks and merged into the Hotfix Release branch (ex release_v5.1)
Hoxfix builds will get tags that read (ex 5.1.xx)
Hotfix releases will be deployed to Staging manually to be tested by QA and UAT folks.
Once UAT clears, the Hotfix Release branch is deployed to production and merged into main and gets a release tag (ex. 5.1.Final)

Deployments
-----------------------
Deployments will be done only from release branches.
Deployments will be manual except for development env.
