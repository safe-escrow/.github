    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>This policy was last updated December 19, 2024.</p>

    <p>The <span th:text='${workspace_name}'></span> App (the "App") Privacy Policy describes the information Safe
        Health
        Systems, Inc. and its affiliates, authorized service providers, partners and agents (collectively, "SHS", "us"
        or
        "we" or "our") in connection with your use of the App and its associated websites, mobile applications, and all
        other related services (the "Services"), and the privacy choices we offer. This Policy applies to information we
        collect when you access or use our Services, or when you otherwise interact with us with regard to the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the
        updated
        policy via our Services, revising the "Last Updated" date above, and by notifying you at your next sign in to
        the
        App. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you use our Services to stay informed about our
        information practices and about ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Important Notices</h2>

    <p><strong>EU Privacy Rights.</strong> For users that are citizens of the European Union ("EU"), this Privacy Policy
        is
        subject to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and other applicable privacy laws.
        In
        such a case, we are a data "Controller" and you are a "Data Subject" with certain protected privacy rights
        concerning your "Personal Data." We will take commercially reasonable steps to maintain compliance with GDPR
        requirements. Your Personal Data may identify you as a person, and thus is often referred to as Personally
        Identifiable Information ("PII").</p>

    <p><strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong> The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") of 2018 enhances privacy
        rights and consumer protection for residents of California. Under the CCPA, California residents have the rights
        to:
        1) know what Personal Data are being collected about them; 2) know whether their Personal Data are sold or
        disclosed, and to whom; 3) say 'no' to the sale of their Personal Data; 4) access their Personal Data; and 5)
        not be
        discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights under the CCPA. California law allows California
        residents
        to request information regarding our disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of their PII to third
        parties.
        To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@safehealth.me">support@safehealth.me</a>.
        Please include enough detail for us to locate your file; at a minimum, your name, email and username, if any. We
        will attempt to provide you with the requested information within thirty (30) days of receipt. We reserve our
        right
        not to respond to requests sent more than once in a calendar year, or requests submitted to an address other
        than
        the one posted in this notice. Please note that this law does not cover all information sharing. Our disclosure
        only
        includes information covered by the law.</p>

    <p><strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") Privacy Rights.</strong> HIPAA (as amended
        by
        the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ("HITECH") Act of 2009 and the HIPAA Omnibus
        Final Rule) protects your rights to privacy with respect to your healthcare-related Personal Data. We have the
        duty
        and responsibility to protect the privacy and security of your Protected Health Information ("PHI") and
        Electronic
        Health Records ("EHR") (as defined in the HIPAA Regulations) that we access or that come into our possession. We
        will take commercially reasonable steps to maintain compliance with HIPAA requirements. We support and
        facilitate
        the timely and unimpeded flow of health information for lawful and appropriate purposes.</p>

    <h2>Collection of Information</h2>

    <h3>Information You Provide</h3>

    <p>We collect information you provide, such as when you email us, sign up for the Services, or submit information
        through the Services. We may collect, but are not limited to collecting:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Personally Identifiable information ("PII"), such as your name, email address, residence and mailing
            address,
            phone number, sex, date of birth, other demographic information and sensitive PII, such as race, and
            ethnicity;
        </li>
        <li>Protected Health Information ("PHI"), such as your symptoms and exposure to infectious disease, diagnostic
            test
            results and related information, your medical history, and elevated temperature readings, and your questions
            regarding medical issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We Collect from Your Use of the Services</h3>

    <p>We collect information about you when you use our Services, including, but not limited to the following:</p>

    <p>Device Information. We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including
        mobile
        devices) you use to access the Services. For example, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP
        addresses, geolocation information (as described in the next section below), unique device identifiers and other
        information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language, operating
        system,
        the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to the ways in which you
        interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks,
        domain
        names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on
        particular
        pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs, and other
        similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies,
        including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>GPS Location Services. If you allow the App to access your location, the App may use your location to
            identify
            nearby lab testing facilities and/or shipping facilities for returning samples to diagnostic laboratories.
            In
            addition, we may collect information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address,
            zip
            code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the
            Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information,
            advertising,
            and features. For example, if your IP address indicates an origin in Los Angeles, California, the Services
            may
            be customized with Los Angeles-specific information. In order to do this, your location information may be
            shared with our agents or vendors. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want
            your
            device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can choose not to allow the App to access your
            location via GPS, but the App may still collect general information such as your IP address that does not
            rely
            on GPS Location Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Camera. Once you have given permission, the App may access your device’s camera for several purposes, depending
        on
        how you use the App. If you choose to take and upload a profile photo, or to scan your insurance card, the App
        will
        access your camera to perform these functions. If you use the App to assist you in taking a remote diagnostic
        test,
        your camera will be needed to scan a QR or 2D Data Matrix code to identify the test kit you are using. If you
        use
        the App to allow a proctor review of your specimen collection for a test, the App will access your camera in
        order
        to display your actions to a proctor who can confirm that your specimen was collected according to instructions.
        This interaction is not recorded or stored. If the App supports a digital interpretation of your test results,
        the
        App will access your camera in order to scan your test to determine the result. The App also supports a mode of
        use
        designed for staff and administrators of test and vaccine verification programs, such as those implemented by
        employers or schools. While not applicable for most users, in this mode the App will access your camera in order
        to
        scan QR codes indicating the verification status of those being checked.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>External Storage. The App may access external file storage, such as an SD card, to access a few types of
            information. The App may retrieve your profile image for use on the App home page, if you choose to upload
            one.
            Your profile image will be used on the homepage to personalize your account. The App also may access photos
            of
            your insurance card or diagnostic tests, if you have chosen to take such photos while using the App.
            Administrators of your account are able to access these images, even when the app is closed and not in use.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>GPS Location Services. If you allow the App to access your location, the App may use your location to identify
        nearby
        lab testing facilities and/or shipping facilities for returning samples to diagnostic laboratories. In addition,
        we
        may collect information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more
        specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), and may use
        that
        information to customize the Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. For example,
        if
        your IP address indicates an origin in Los Angeles, California, the Services may be customized with Los
        Angeles-specific information. In order to do this, your location information may be shared with our agents or
        vendors. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with
        location-tracking information, you can choose not to allow the App to access your location via GPS, but the App
        may
        still collect general information such as your IP address that does not rely on GPS Location Services.</p>

    <p>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We may use the tools outlined below in order to better understand
        users.
        As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

    <p>Cookies: "Cookies" are small computer files transferred to your computing device that contain information such as
        user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while using the Services. We may use
        Cookies to help us improve or tailor the Services by tracking your navigation habits, storing your
        authentication
        status so you do not have to re-enter your credentials each time you use the Services, customizing your
        experience
        with the Services, and for analytics and fraud prevention. For more information on cookies, visit <a
            href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a></p>s

    <p>Web Beacons: "Web Beacons" (a.k.a. clear GIFs or pixel tags) are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page
        or
        email that may be used to collect anonymous information about your use of our Services, the websites of selected
        partners, and the emails, special promotions or newsletters that we send you. The information collected by Web
        Beacons allows us to analyze how many people are using the Services, using the selected partners' websites or
        opening our emails, and for what purpose.</p>

    <p>Website Analytics: We may use third-party website analytics services in connection with the website, including,
        for
        example, to register mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity and text that you type into the website
        or
        mobile application. These website analytics services generally do not collect personal information unless you
        voluntarily provide it and generally do not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use their
        services. We use the information collected from these services to help make the website easier to use.</p>

    <p>Mobile Device Identifiers: Mobile device identifiers are data stored on your mobile device that may track the
        mobile
        device, and the data and activities occurring on and through it, as well as the applications installed on it.
        Mobile
        device identifiers enable collection of personal information (such as media access control, address and
        location)
        and traffic data. Mobile device identifiers help us learn more about our users’ demographics and internet
        behaviors.
    </p>

    <p>Information from Third Parties</p>

    <p>We may obtain additional information about you from third parties, such as healthcare entities or laboratory
        providers of testing and analytics services, researchers, and others. We may combine information that we collect
        from you with information about you that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any
        other
        service we provide.</p>

    <p>Aggregate or De-identified Data</p>

    <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the
        information
        is not intended to identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not
        subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for
        any
        purpose, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>Use of Information</p>

    <p>We use the information that we collect for the following purposes:</p>

    <p>To personalize your experience with the Services by informing you of products, programs, events, services, and
        promotions of ours, our partners and/or third parties that we believe may be of interest to you (see the "Opt-In
        Policy" below);</p>

    <p>To provide, maintain, administer, improve, or expand the Services, perform business analysis, or for other
        internal
        purposes to support, improve or enhance our business, the Services, and other products and services we offer;
    </p>

    <p>To contact you when necessary or requested;</p>

    <p>To customize and tailor your experience of the Services;</p>

    <p>To send mobile notifications (you may opt-out of this service);</p>

    <p>To send emails and other communications that display content that we think will interest you and according to
        your
        preferences;</p>

    <p>To send you news and information about our Services;</p>

    <p>To track and analyze trends and usage in connection with our Services;</p>

    <p>To better understand who uses the Services and how we can deliver a better user experience;</p>

    <p>To combine information received from third parties with the information that we have from or about you and use
        the
        combined information for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;</p>

    <p>To use statistical information that we collect in any way permitted by law, including from third parties in
        connection with their commercial and marketing efforts;</p>

    <p>To prevent, detect, and investigate security breaches, fraud, and other potentially illegal or prohibited
        activities;
    </p>

    <p>To enforce the legal terms that govern your use of the Services;</p>

    <p>To protect our rights or property;</p>

    <p>To administer and troubleshoot the Services; and</p>

    <p>For any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our Services.</p>

    <p>We may use third-party service providers to process and store personal information in the United States and other
        countries.</p>

    <p>Sharing of Information</p>

    <p>We may share personal information about you as follows:</p>

    <p>With third parties to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including service providers who access
        information
        about you to perform services on our behalf;</p>

    <p>With our affiliates and partners so that they may use such information for the purposes described in this Privacy
        Policy;</p>

    <p>If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal
        process or
        governmental request, to enforce applicable user agreements or policies; to protect the security or integrity of
        our
        Services; and to protect us, our users or the public from harm or illegal activities; and</p>

    <p>With your consent, we may also share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with third parties.</p>

    <p>Security</p>

    <p>We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to help protect
        personal
        information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
        Unfortunately,
        no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we take
        industry-standard steps to protect your information (e.g., strong encryption), we cannot ensure or warrant the
        security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your
        own
        risk.</p>s

    <p>For PHI and EHR data subject to HIPAA, we securely store and maintain such data and records in compliance with
        the
        HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule Standards. We or our service providers maintain all HIPAA-related documentation
        in
        electronic form on HIPAA-compliant, HITRUST-certified data storage facilities.</p>

    <p>If you are using the Services from outside of the USA, you understand that your connection will be through and to
        servers located in the USA, and the information you provide will be securely stored in our web servers and
        internal
        systems located within the USA. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you
        consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the USA, where you may not have the
        same
        rights and protections as you do under your local law.</p>

    <p>Data Retention</p>

    <p>General. We store your Personal Data for as long as reasonably required for its purpose or for any additional
        period
        required by law. We will delete your account information and Personal Data when you terminate your use of the
        Services, or when we delete your account. We may store information longer for legitimate business reasons (for
        example, Personal Data may remain in backups for a reasonable period of time), or as legally required.
        Otherwise, we
        store your Personal Data until you request us to remove it from our servers. We store our logs and other
        technical
        records indefinitely.</p>

    <p>HIPAA-Related Data. For PHI and EHR data subject to HIPAA, our data retention policy is as follows:</p>

    <p>We retain all HIPAA-related data and records for a minimum period of six (6) years from the date of creation or
        modification, or the date when such data were last in effect, whichever is later.</p>

    <p>In the event that local/state laws require a longer duration for retention of healthcare records, we retain such
        data
        for the duration specified by law, but no less than six (6) years.</p>

    <p>When deleting HIPAA-related data, we use a soft-delete functionality wherever possible, so that the data can be
        accessed or recovered by a system administrator. If you require permanent deletion of your Personal Data, you
        may
        send a written request to us for approval before the data can be deleted by an administrator.</p>

    <p>We may delete HIPAA-related PHI or EHR in a verifiable manner only when required or permitted by applicable laws
        and
        regulations, and we maintain a record of such deletions for a minimum period of six (6) years from the date of
        the
        deletion.</p>

    <p>We ensure that all HIPAA-related data and documentation are available to members of our workforce only on a
        need-to-know basis, and as required by their job functions via user-specific account access restrictions.</p>

    <p>How We Respond to Browser "Do Not Track" Signals</p>

    <p>We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently
        still
        working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions. For more information about DNT signals, visit
        <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/">http://allaboutdnt.com/</a></p>

    <p>Links to Other Websites</p>

        we
        do. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. We encourage you to read the
        privacy
        policies of such third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.</p>

    <p>Children</p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 18 years of age
        without verifiable parental consent. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use the Services
        without a
        parent or legal guardian present. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons less than 18
        years
        of age has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete
        this information. To make such a request, please contact us at <a
            href="mailto:support@safehealth.me">support@safehealth.me</a>.</p>
